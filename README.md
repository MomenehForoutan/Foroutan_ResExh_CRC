This repository includes the scripts and small data dependencies associated with the manuscript Foroutan M et al, bioRxiv (2020). The ratio of exhausted to resident infiltrating lymphocytes is prognostic for colorectal cancer patient outcome.

Available folders contain the below files:
- data: small data dependencies for each of the single cell and bulk data sets
- output: small data files obtained using the analysis pipelines
- report: several .Rmd reports; figures are genearted as part of the report (they are not exported as a separate file). There are separate reports for each of the CD8, CD4, and NK cell, for training and testing the signatures in single cell data sets, and for each of the TCGA and Marisa data. There are a few additional scripts comparing the signatures as well as the results of the survival analyses from independent datasets.
- script: some custom and collected functions used in this study.
